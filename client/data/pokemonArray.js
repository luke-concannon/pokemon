Not only is it absolutely adorable, but it represents Pokémon at its most inventive and finest. This doesn’t look enough like a turtle to be a turtle – the head shape is weird, and it has claws, plus a big bulb on its back. It looks like an entirely new creature, but also, kind of with the aura of a cat. And cats are lovely, cool, and you want to hug them.”",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/bulbasaur.jpg"},

Even better, it’s a butterfly with eyes because by far the most terrifying thing about butterflies is the fact that they don’t have eyes. Did you know Nicole Kidman is deathly afraid of butterflies? Oh to be rich and have access to many wigs. Butterfree is here because Butterfree is beautiful, and for the very specific reason that if you chose Charmander in Pokémon Red/Blue as a starter, then Butterfree was your most foolproof way of getting past the first gym, because it learned Confusion at level ten. That’s a little tip for you, should you find yourself playing the original Pokémon for nostalgia reasons.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/butterfree.jpg"},

It’s very easy to mess up the design of a dragon – look at Smaug from The Hobbit films (or so I assume, I didn’t see them and have no intention on doing so) – but Charizard is a unique twist on a well-hewn classic. By which I mean, honestly, he has a flame at the end of his tail, has cool wings, and is a nice shade of orange. I’ve run out of words by this point, but I trust that lots of people love Charizard as much as I do, and he’s one of the few Pokémon to break out past the game/show into other materials! But honestly, he’s just a fire dragon. Sometimes that’s all you need.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/charizard.jpg"},

However, it’s clear that it’s always crying.” “Cubone pines for the mother it will never see again. Seeing a likeness of its mother in the full moon, it cries. The stains on the skull the Pokémon wears are made by the tears it sheds.” It’s a metaphor for grief, and not a very subtle one!",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/cubone.jpg"},

It looks like something that you conceivably might own as a pet in the real world, as bleak and dark and boring as the real world is.

Since it was once human itself, it tries to create one by taking the lives of other humans.” “You can hear tales told all over the world about how Gengar will pay a visit to children who are naughty.” “Even your home isn’t safe.

It’s one of the only creatures in the Pokémon universe that I think could only come from Pokémon – and when I think of memorable, distinctive Pokémon it’s usually Gloom that comes to mind. For me, it’s representative of Pokémon at its best – a creature that is neither animal nor spirit nor plant, and yet you want to build a relationship and conquer the world with it anyway. I would happily spend my adolescence and adult life with Gloom, a drooling flower that emits a stench that can be smelled over a mile away, and that says nothing nice about me as a person. Look, a whole lot of you scrolled past the six thousand carefully constructed words and thoughts just to get to this point, only to disagree with me. Maybe reconsider your choices if you’ve done that!

It is a pleasant shade of blue, but there’s also a red one which had a story role in Pokémon Silver and Gold which I kind of like better than the blue one.

And, as a person who exists in the present moment, I know that golliwogs are bad.

    {name:"Nidoran-f",blurb:"God, just looking at this thing makes me want to reach for my cords and get them out of its reach.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/nidoran-f.jpg"},
    {name:"Nidoran-m",blurb:"I like this one slightly more than Nidoran M because it has a little bit more sass and personality. It’d still bite through my $150 MacBook charger (seriously, how do those things never oscillate in price?) but it might wink at me while it does it.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/nidoran-m.jpg"},
    {name:"Nidorina",blurb:"Lots of Pokémon have clear correlations to other creatures. Some are clearly rats, some are clearly birds, some are clearly kitchen magnets. I don’t know what Nidorina is. It’s definitely a mammal, but it is weirdly shapeless! It kind of looks like a mean pig! But it has pretty colours and looks quite savage.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/nidorina.jpg"},
    {name:"Nidorino",blurb:"This has the same relationship to Nidorina that Nidoran (M) has to Nidoran (F). It has a little bit more personality, by which I mean it has a horn. And look, we’re in the middle reaches. I generally like every Pokémon from this point onwards, and the rankings are only very slightly arbitrary!",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/nidorino.jpg"},
    {name:"Ninetales",blurb:"What’s better than a fire fox with one tail? A fire fox with nine tails, with all the elegance and certifiably unreasonable ego of a supermodel. Also, I love a Pokémon that is canonically, scientifically, petty as all hell: “It is vindictive and relentless by nature. Those who cross it even once will be cursed for a thousand years, along with their descendants.” Same, honestly.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/ninetales.jpg"},
    {name:"Oddish",blurb:"Imagine you’re some kind of farmhand who is assigned the busywork of pulling turnips out of the field. Maybe you’re a serf of some kind. Let your imagination run wild. Now you pull out one of those turnips and it smiles at you. It has eyes, it has a mouth, also it’s blue. It’s not a turnip. It’s an Oddish. Fun! However, consulting our Pokedex once more: “During the day, it keeps its face buried in the ground. At night, it wanders around sowing its seeds.” The idea of dozens, hundreds, thousands of these things wandering around at night puts the fear of God into me. What are they sowing. What do they want. What’s their purpose.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/oddish.jpg"},
    {name:"Omanyte",blurb:"This looks like a growth I would ignore underneath my bathroom sink for far too long, and it would eventually lead to my death. This is the Daisy Buchanan of Pokémon. I will not be taking questions on this.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/omanyte.jpg"},

    {name:"Parasect",blurb:"Parasect is literally a Paras that got possessed and taken over by the mushrooms on its back. Turning once more to our Pokedex friend: “A host-parasite pair in which the parasite mushroom has taken over the host bug. Prefers damp places.” “The bug host is drained of energy by the mushrooms on its back. They appear to do all the thinking.” “It stays mostly in dark, damp places, the preference not of the bug, but of the big mushrooms on its back.” “The bug is mostly dead, with the mushroom on its back having become the main body. If the mushroom comes off, the bug stops moving.” Pokémon doesn’t often go dark like this, but holy shit when it goes dark, it goes dark.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/parasect.jpg"},

    {name:"Pidgeot",blurb:"On the other hand, Pidgeot feels like the same in reverse. The artist started with Pidgeotto – a simple, but elegant design – and just added a few more plumes and called it a day. But that day? Was not a good day.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/pidgeot.jpg"},
    {name:"Pidgeotto",blurb:"Elegant bird! If I was a weirdo who used birds to hunt, this is the bird I would use to hunt. It’s a bit bland, but there’s enough colour.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/pidgeotto.jpg"},
    {name:"Pidgey",blurb:"Bird.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/pidgey.jpg"},
    {name:"Pikachu",blurb:"Okay now look. I know Pikachu is the series’ mascot, and by far the most popular Pokémon. I know that Pikachu has his own live-action/CGI mutant-hybrid film coming out soon, which seems like the worst possible version of someone wishing that Pokémon were real and instead realising that fantasy, fantasy through a screen is safer. I like Pikachu! He has a great, recognizable design. Electric rat whose drag mother didn’t teach it how to use rouge properly. It takes a lot to pull off bright yellow, and Pikachu does it. There’s no hate here, just less love. I would call it nuance, but there’s 27 Pokémon left and god knows nuance has left me.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/pikachu.jpg"},
    {name:"Pinsir",blurb:"I don’t know what it is about vertical mouths that make me uncomfortable, but goddamnit they do! Also, a boring shade of brown.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/pinsir.jpg"},
    {name:"Poliwag",blurb:"This Pokémon, adorable and innocent, was ranked higher until I decided to peruse that unholy tome of information, the Pokedex: “Its slick black skin is thin and damp. A part of its internal organs can be seen through the skin as a spiral pattern.” Absolutely. Not.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/poliwag.jpg"},
    {name:"Poliwhirl",blurb:"Satoshi Tajiri is the creator of Pokémon, and Poliwhirl is his favourite Pokémon. I can see why – Poliwhirl splits the difference between cutesy Poliwag and too-burly Poliwrath. It’s a pleasing shape, a pleasing colour, and its fists balance out the design really well.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/poliwhirl.jpg"},
    {name:"Poliwrath",blurb:"When I was a child, I didn’t expect that I would be typing “Where the mouth?” so much, but here we are. Where is this creature’s mouth? Why is it making me think about what a buff frog would look like? How does a frog even get buff? Where’s the frog gym, just so I know so I can stay far, far away from it!",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/poliwrath.jpg"},

    {name:"Porygon",blurb:"It’s the one who anecdotally gave a lot of Japanese kids seizures when his episode aired! This may be an urban legend, but damned if I’m going to use the internet at my fingertips and find out. If it’s a virtual creature that lives in a computer – why does it have eyes?",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/porygon.jpg"},
    {name:"Primeape",blurb:"Big round angry furry circle. Its paws and two-toed feet unnerve me.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/primeape.jpg"},
    {name:"Psyduck",blurb:"It’s a duck with mental health issues, and those mental health issues make it so powerful that it literally cannot function in the world. I relate hard to this duck, is all.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/psyduck.jpg"},
    {name:"Raichu",blurb:"I feel like Raichu gets a bad rap just because the Pikachu on the anime refuses to evolve into one, but I am solidly pro-Raichu. It takes all the best parts of Pikachu and turns up the volume on it. Pikachu’s over-rouged cheeks? Big yellow cheeks, baby! Pikachu’s kinda weird ears? Big floofy (it has taken me until 15 to use that cursed word) ears instead! Pikachu’s lightning bolt tail! Put it at the end of a whip!",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/raichu.jpg"},

    {name:"Raticate",blurb:"Do a little exercise for me. Say the word ‘raticate’ (rat-a-cate, as in Cate Blanchett) like you’re a rat who has learned how to speak English. Did you do it? Good. Didn’t it sound awful? Raticate is also basically the flipside of Ratatouille – a rat you wouldn’t trust in your kitchen, and definitely not to cook.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/raticate.jpg"},

    {name:"Slowbro",blurb:"Let’s have a few facts about Slowbro, shall we? “Naturally dull to begin with, it lost its ability to feel pain due to Shellder’s seeping poison.” “Its tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can’t be used for fishing anymore. This forces it to reluctantly swim and catch prey.” “An attached Shellder won’t let go because of the tasty flavor that oozes out of its tail.” “Shellder, in its greed to suck out more and more sweetness from Slowbro’s tail, has metamorphosed into a spiral-shaped shell.” If only we were all as chill and/or numbed to constant pain as Slowbro is. Go forth, bro.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/slowbro.jpg"},

    {name:"Snorlax",blurb:"Snorlax is a body positivity icon you guys! Look at this big guy. He literally sleeps and eats all day! I love him, and if there’s one Pokémon that I’ve always, genuinely wanted to exist in real life, it’s this one. Imagine curling up on that belly and sleeping. We love a thousand-pound queen who lets little kids play on its belly!",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/snorlax.jpg"},
    {name:"Spearow",blurb:"This one splits the difference between something that I instinctively want to wave away from my face and a cool design – sharp angles, cool colour scheme, and it looks genuinely pissed off about something. You cut this bird off in traffic, and she wants revenge.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/spearow.jpg"},

    {name:"Staryu",blurb:"Another one of those Pokémon where it feels like they came up with the second evolution first, then had to come up with the pre-evolution and just made it a bit more bland and dull so you got excited for the second evolution. Which is to say, this is a simple starfish.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/staryu.jpg"},
    {name:"Tangela",blurb:"Vines, sneakers and the eyes emoji. Sometimes the designs that feel like they came out of a last-minute rush to get to 151 are, by pure accident, the best. Or the eleventh best.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/tangela.jpg"},
    {name:"Tauros",blurb:"Sometimes you feel that they phoned it in with a Pokémon or two. This one is literally just a buffalo, which I guess might be exotic if you’re in Japan.

    {name:"Tentacruel",blurb:"There’s not a lot of Pokémon that look straight up villainous – even the ghosts or dark type Pokémon look more spooky than villains. But this guy? With his massive horn, his tentacles and his dead eyes? He wants to do you harm, and I’m into it. It’s even in the name? It’s Tentacruel, not Tentalovely.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/tentacruel.jpg"},
    {name:"Vaporeon",blurb:"There’s not a lot of Pokémon that actually blend the aquatic and the mammalian (what a word) together, and Vaporeon does that well. The scales look pretty and elegant while still looking distinctly like something from the ocean, and yet it’s definitely some kind of fox-dog blend. The ruffles help! I have nothing funny to say here. Vaporeon just pretty.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/vaporeon.jpg"},
    {name:"Venomoth",blurb:"Elegant moth. The elegance is offset by the fact that it’s a goddamned moth, which combines the worst parts of being a bird and being an insect.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/venomoth.jpg"},
    {name:"Venonat",blurb:"Useless trivia and maybe an urban legend/straight up falsification: Venonat should evolve into Butterfree, not Venomoth. Based on their identical eyes and colouring, that makes way more sense. Somebody messed up, at some stage, and this is what we have. Venonat is a cute little bug thing. If it showed up in my lounge I’d let it live.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/venonat.jpg"},
    {name:"Venusaur",blurb:"This has a similar issue of Blastoise, but a more interesting design – it takes two interesting, distinct pre-evolutions and mistakes size, grittiness and weight for an appealing design. There’s also the dissonance between its two pre-evolutions – scrappy cat-reptile things that looked like they moved super quick – and this lumbering lofty tree-dog. It makes me feel weird, and I don’t like that!",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/venusaur.jpg"},
    {name:"Victreebel",blurb:"On the flipside of that, Victreebel takes every that is bad about Weepinbell, who you may remember is ranked at 147, and turns it into an asset. Gone is the upsettingly dead-eyed open mouth and in its place is a plant that wants you dead in its two-toothed maw. Also, purely from a design standpoint, the mouth on the top of the head is pretty unique and a cool twist on the ‘murderous plant’ trope we’ve all seen a million times before.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/victreebel.jpg"},
    {name:"Vileplume",blurb:"I like looking at this Pokémon! The big floppy flower is almost like a cowboy hat. When it tips its big, toxic, absolutely deadly flower it’s like its saying, “Top o’ the morning to ya laddie!” Which is less cowboy, more Irish. I hate thinking about this Pokémon! How heavy is that flower? Can it stand upright? Let’s consult the Pokedex, for the first time in this ranking: “The larger its petals, the more toxic pollen it contains. Its big head is heavy and hard to hold up.” Nope! No thank you! Poor thing!",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/vileplume.jpg"},

Vulpix looks like the softest creature on earth, and look at those tails! So fluffy! As the little girl says in modern cinema classic Despicable Me, “It is so fluffy I could die!” or words to that effect. Plus, it’s a fire fox.",image:"http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/vulpix.jpg"},
